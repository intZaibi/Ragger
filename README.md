**🚀 RAG Project with Next.js, Clerk, and Qdrant**

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Next.js.
It combines Clerk (authentication), Qdrant (vector database), and Google’s Generative AI (embeddings + LLM responses) to provide a question-answering system that can reason over your own data.

✨ Features

Source Indexing: Upload files (PDF, CSV), paste raw text, or provide a URL to index content into Qdrant.

Chat Interface: Ask natural language questions about your indexed data.

Authentication: Secure sign-in and user management powered by Clerk.

Scalable Vector Search: Efficient and scalable similarity search with Qdrant.

🔧 Use Cases

📝 Personal Knowledge Base – Store and query your notes, articles, and documents.

🤖 Customer Support Bot – Train on product documentation for instant support.

🔍 Research Assistant – Search and synthesize from a corpus of papers.

📚 Educational Tool – Let students query their course materials interactively.
